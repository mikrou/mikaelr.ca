	<div id="intro">
	<p>Thank you for visiting my website.</p>
	<p>I am 24 years old, born and raised in Edmonton, Alberta.
	In April 2013, I received my BSc degree in Computer Engineering Co-op from the U of A. I am a huge fan of technology, so this degree is quite fitting for me. Instead of specializing in a computer option such as software, computer science or nano-engineering, I strategically opted for the general computer engineering. This gives me knowledge in all aspects of computers, and gives me more freedom in where to work; including IT, software, hardware, and electrical engineering. Being in Co-op also allowed me to get a year and a half of engineering work experience while obtaining my degree. I am always on a mission to learn about the latest gadgets, and keeping my programming experience sharp by reviewing textbooks and online tutorials.</p>
	<p>I take pride in my work, and the links provided highlight some of my achievments. You will notice that my achievments are not all computer related; This is to show that I am highly adaptable, and can excel in <em>anything</em> that interests me.</p> </div>
